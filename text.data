The weight of an object is equal to the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted on the object 
and varies with location.
For example, a person who weighs 180 kgs on the Earth weighs only about 30 kgs on the Moon. 
On the other hand, the mass of an object is the same ever everywhere: an object
having a mass of 2 kg on the Earth also has a mass of 2 kg on the Moon.
